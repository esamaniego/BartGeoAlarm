# BartGeoAlarm


Problem statement: If taking public transportation, sometimes one misses his/her stop either because they were not paying attention, busy doing something else, or just dozed off. This app tries to solve that. This will app will alarm based on location (instead of time).

Using BART as the environment, the app shows a map listing bart stations. The user taps the icon for the desired station to set the alarm. When the train is within distance of the location, the alarm goes off.
